# **Jeffery Park's LHL Week 2 Notes**

## **Day 1 Lecture Notes**

`module.exports` is a variable/empty object so to export multiple functions in one file, the functions need to be stored in object/array format.\
When requiring a file, the whole file is brought in so any `console.log`s will get printed.\

`npmjs.com` is like Amazon of npm where you can download codes that other people posted!\

## NPM

- `npm init`
  - to initialize npm in the directory
  - creates package.json file
  - enter through for default or `npm init -y`
  - now can add other people's codes
- don't recommend installing globally
  - npm install --global mocha
- instead, install directly in the project
  - npm install --save-dev mocha
    - development dependency: only used for development purpose
- installing mocha installs not only mocha, but also other codes that mocha depends on (dependencides)
  - dev-dependencies don't get installed (optional)
    - ex. chai

### Mocha

- test to see if your code passed or not
- `describe()` and `it()` are built-in functions in mocha
- `describe()` describes the test (optional)
  - `describe("description", () => {})`
- `it()` is the test

  - `it("what it should do", () => {})`

  `throw new Error("error message")`

### Chai

- **assertion library** for mocha
- `const chai = require('chai'); && const assert = chai.assert;` === `const assert = require('chai').assert`

### Ignoring Files/Folders

- we don't want to add node_modules folder into our git since it's too large and unnecessary
- `touch .gitignore`
  - go into the file and include node_modules
  - `git status` will exlude node_modules

### TDD (Test Driven Development)

- we write the tests first
- then we code
- Red: all tests are failing
- Green: write the minimum amount of code to make the test pass

## **Day 1 Compass Notes**

**Asynchronous programming** is when a unit of work is run separately from the main thread of the program and notifies the program of its completion.

### setTimeout

**setTimeout** is used to delay the execution of some code to later. We specify the code via a callback and the delay in ms.

- setTimeout(callback, delay)

Almost all web applications (websites) in like to schedule something to occur a bit later on their webpage(s) and therefore use **setTimeout**

- Show a notice to the user and then automatically hide it after a few seconds
- Try to reconnect after # seconds
- Open an in-browser chat buttom after a few seconds
- Website asking to disable Adblocker after a few seconds

## **Day 2 Lecture Notes**

### **fs library**

`fs` (file system) is a library in node.js

`fs.readFile(filename, encoding, callback_function)`

`const fs = require("fs")`

Example:

```js
fs.readFile("/Users/joe/test.txt", "utf8", (err, data) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
    return;
  }
  console.log(data);
});
```

-

### **request library**

Request brings in a website

`npm install request`

`const request = require("request");`

`request("URL", function(error, response, body) => {})`

## **Day 2 Compass Notes**

`setTimeout(() => {}, delay in ms)`

- Even if the delay is set to 0, still gets put into background thread first then get executed
  - Other codes (non-delayed ones) get executed first

`setInterval(() => {}, delay in ms)`

`process.stdout`

- _stdout_ is for "standard output"
- `process.stdout.write()`: print in one line
  - as opposed to console.log, which prints each console.log in new line)

`process.stdin`

- _stdin_ is for "standard input"
- `process.stdin.on()`
  - `on` method is used on `stdin` to register a callback
    - Run any time the user provides input to the program
    - Commonly used for registering callbacks to handle events

Example:

```js
process.stdin.on("data", (key) => {
  process.stdout.write(".");
});
```

- Callback function is called each time there is new user input data and "." is printed to the screen

## **Day 3 Lecture Notes**

### SERVER

Back-end server\
`port:` anything above 1024 is temporary (don't need admin)

`const server = net.createServer()`

- `.createServer()` is a factory function
- Created a server

`server.listen(port, function() {})`

- Have the server listen to a particular port for incoming connections

`server.on('connection', function(client) {})`

- `.on` is a function that sets up an event listener
  - "on connection, do callback function"
- `'connection'` is an event
- callback function runs whenever connection event occurs in the server
- `client` is an object

### CLIENT

Front-end

```js
const client = net.createConnection({
  host: "localhost",
  port: port,
});
```

- `.createConnection()` is a factory function
- Connecting to a certain port number (port) on a certain computer (host)

`client.on('connect', function() {})`

- `connect` is an event; callback function runs when the event occurs

`client.on('data', function() {})`

- `data` is an event; callback function runs when the event occurs
- How the client received data from the server

`client.setEncoding('utf8')`

- Variable-width character encoding used for electronic communication

## **Day 3 Compass Notes**

### **HTTP**

- _HyperText_ is text which contains link to other text
- **HTTP** (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used to read and write resources (data) in a simple text-based manner
  - Request-response based protocol
    - Client makes a request to an HTTP server, sending a message asking for a specific resource
    - Server sends down as a response
      - Server cannot send a response if there is no request

### **HTTP Messages**

There are two types of HTTP messages, requests and responses, each with its own format

**Requests**
![alt text](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview/http_request.png)

- _Method (verb):_
  - What method it would like to perform
  - GET: used to "get" some data from the server
  - POST: usually used to create some new data
  - PUT: generally used for editing existing data on the server
  - DELETE: used to delete some existing data
- _Path_
  - What resource the client wants to act on
  - The path of the resource to fetch
    - The URL of the resource stripped from elements that are obvious from the context

**Responses**
![alt text](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Overview/http_response.png)

- _Status code_
  - A three-digit number that the server puts in the response to let the client know whether or not the operation was successful
    - 200: "Everything went great!"
    - 201: "The request has succeeded and a new resource has been created as a result."
    - 404: "Resource was not found."
    - 500: "The server had an error."
- _Body_
  - The response will usually contain some data, such as the data the client originally requested
    - This data is stored in a part of the response (body)

### **URL**

**URL** (Uniform Resource Locator) is the mechanism used by browsers to retrieve any published resource on the web.

- The address of a given unique resource on the Web
- Each valid URL points to a unique resource
  - HTML pag, CSS document, image, etc.

![alt text](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL/mdn-url-all.png)
![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DominicTremblay/w2d3-lecture/demo-east-nov23-2020/url.png)

- URL <=> postal mail address

  - domain name <=> city/town
  - port <=> zip code
  - path <=> building
  - parameters <=> extra info
  - anchor <=> person to whom mail is addressed to

- **API** (Application Programming Interface) is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other

## **Day 4 Lecture Notes**

### Promise

- Promise is a JS object that will (hopefully) resolve to a value in the future
  - Used in anything asynchronous
    - Anything that takes non-zero amount of time
- Pending
  - Sitting in the pending state until it is resolved
- Fulfilled/Resolved
- Failed/Rejected
- `.then(() => {}):` Get the value back from promise as soon as it is resolved

```js
myPromise.then((value) => {
  console.log(value);
});
```

- `.catch(() => {}):`

```js
myPromise.catch((err) => {
  console.log(err);
});
```

- `Promise.all():` Grab all promises together and turn them into one promise
  - Only works if all promises are resolved

## **Day 4 Compass Notes**

### JSON

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a data format that underpins many modern web services and it a subset of the JS language.
JSON is built on two structures:

- A collection of *name:value* pairs
- An ordered list of values

```js
{
  "name": "New York City",
  "boroughs": [
    "Manhattan",
    "Queens",
    "Brooklyn",
    "The Bronx",
    "Staten Island"],
  "population": 8491079,
  "area_codes": [212, 347, 646, 718, 917, 929],
  "position": { "lat": 40.7127, "lng": -74.0059 }
}
```

- *Keys* are always double-quoted *"strings"*
- Values can be numbers, strings, objects, arrays, booleans and null

**Serialization**
The process of serialization coverts objects (or data structures) into a format that can be stored or transmitted between computers (typically as a string of text)

- Opposite is deserialization (string -> object)

`JSON.parse():` Parse a string as JSON, optionally transform the produced value and its properties, and return the value.

`JSON.stringify():` Return a JSON string corresponding to the specified value, optionally including only certain properties or replacing property values in a user-defined manner.

```js
const jsonString = '{"a": 1, "b": 2, "foo": "bar"}';
const obj = JSON.parse(jsonString);
// obj = { a: 1, b: 2, foo: "bar"}
const obj2 = JSON.stringify(obj);
// obj2 = '{"a": 1, "b": 2, "foo": "bar"}'
```

### **Promise**

- A promise represents the **eventual result** of an asynchronous operation

  - Promise is an **object**

- Similar to callbacks, promise is a way of dealing with asynchronous codes:

  - When we don't know when things are going to happen in what order
  - More powerful than callbacks because they compose

- A promise needs two callback functions
  - one for success (resolve)
  - one for failure (reject)

```js
Promise((resolve, reject) => {});
```

**Benefits of Using Promise**

- Error handling becomes much simpler
- Asynchronous code becomes easier to unit test

**`.then`**

- Primary way of interaction with a promise
- Registers callbacks to receive either a promise's eventual value or the reason why the promise cannot be fulfilled

## **Day 5 Compass Notes**

### **Object Oriented Programming (OPP)**

- Probably the biggest concept in software development philosophy
- Object Orientation is a way of writing code that:
  - encourages **modularity**
  - **reduces duplication** through the use of objects
- `Object` is a collection of **key-value pairs** known as **properties**
  - Each key-value pair is a **state**
  - When a property's value is a **function**, it is called a **method**
  - Method is also known as the object's **behaviour**
- `this` is used inside an object whenever a method is accessing a property or another method on the same object

```js
const dog = {
  sound: "woof",
  speak: function () {
    console.log(this.sound);
  },
  teachMeSomething: function () {
    if (dog === this) {
      console.log("dog === this");
    }
    this.speak();
  },
};

dog.teachMeSomething();
```

### **OOP Part 1: Classes & Instances**

- **Classes** is a way to perform Object Orientation
- JS's object system is based on another pattern known as _prototypes_
  - Classes were added to JS in ES6
- In OPP, classes are blueprints (templates) that we use to create instances of objects
  - Class describes what the object is going to be
  - New object can be created using the class

```js
class Pizza {
  constructor(size, crust) {
    this.size = size;
    this.crust = crust;
    this.toppings = ["cheese"];
  }

  addTopping(topping) {
    this.toppings.push(topping);
  }
}
let pizza1 = new Pizza("large", "cheese");
let pizza2 = new Pizza();
```

- To declare a class, use `class` keyword along with its name
  - Class name should be a noun
  - First letter of the class name should be capitalized
- New objects can be created from a class using `new` keyword
  - pizza1 and pizza2 are **instances** of the Pizza class
- `constructor` and `addTopping` are _methods_
  - `constructor` gets executed when an object instance is created from a class
    - Default values for an object
    - Since it's a method, values can be passed into it
- `toppings` is a _property_

### **OOP Part 2: Inheritance**

- Classes can share multiple of the same properties
- The duplication can be moved to another class
- `Inheritance` technique allows to build a new class based on an existing class

```js
// This class represents all that is common between Student and Mentor
class Person {
  // moved here b/c it was identical
  constructor(name, quirkyFact) {
    this.name = name;
    this.quirkyFact = quirkyFact;
  }

  // moved here b/c it was identical
  bio() {
    return `My name is ${this.name} and here's my quirky fact: ${this.quirkyFact}`;
  }
}

class Student extends Person {
  // stays in Student class since it's specific to students only
  enroll(cohort) {
    this.cohort = cohort;
  }
}

class Mentor extends Person {
  // specific to mentors
  goOnShift() {
    this.onShift = true;
  }

  // specific to mentors
  goOffShift() {
    this.onShift = false;
  }
}

let student1 = new Student("Jeffery Park", "Hello");
console.log(student1);
```

- _Student_ and _Mentor_ inherit behaviour and state information from _Person_ using the keyword `extends`
  - Person is the **superclass**
  - Student and Mentor are **subclasses** of the Person class
    - They are _extensions_ of Person class

### **OOP Part 3: Super**

- `super` keyword allows subclasses to have a reference on the parent class
  - **method overriding:** when a subclass implements a method that already exists in the superclass
  - Avoid repeating code that is already present in the superclass

```js
// Super class
class Person {
  constructor(name, quirkyFact) {
    this.name = name;
    this.quirkyFact = quirkyFact;
  }

  bio() {
    return `My name is ${this.name} and here's my quirky fact: ${this.quirkyFact}`;
  }
}

class Mentor extends Person {
  // Mentor bios need to include a bit more info
  bio() {
    return `I'm a mentor at Lighthouse Labs. ${super.bio()}`;
  }
}

// DRIVER CODE

const bob = new Mentor("Bob Ross", "I like mountains way too much");
console.log(bob.bio());
```

### **OPP Part 4: Getters and Setters**

- `Getters:` a method used to get the value of a property
- `Setters:` a method used to set the value of a property
- Benefits of using getters and setters
  - **Validating** data before assigning it to a property
  - **Computing** a value on the fly instead of simply pulling it out of a property

```js
class Pizza {
  // ... CODE FROM PART 1 ...

  // setSize now includes data validation
  // size only gets assigned if one of the conditions is true; else undefined
  set size(size) {
    if (size === "s" || size === "m" || size === "l") {
      this._size = size;
    }
  }

  get price() {
    const basePrice = 10;
    const toppingPrice = 2;
    return basePrice + this.toppings.length * toppingPrice;
  }
}

// DRIVER CODE
const pizza = new Pizza();
pizza.size = "s";
pizza.addTopping("pepperoni");
pizza.addTopping("pepper");
console.log(pizza);
console.log(pizza.price);
```

### **OPP Best Practices**

- In JS, properties cannot be made private
  - Simply add `_` to the start of a property name
    - Letting other developers know that the property should not be accessed directly (outside the class)
    - ```js
      class Pizza {
        constructor() {
          this._toppings = [];
        }
        addTopping(topping) {
          this._toppings.push(topping);
        }
      }
      let pizza = new Pizza();
      pizza.addTopping("cheese");
      pizza.addTopping("mushrooms");
      ```
- Each class should be responsible for a single part of the functionality
- Inheritance

## **WE Compass Notes**

### **Promise**

- Promise is a try-catch wrapper around code that will finish at an unpredictable time
- Four keywords related to promise
  - **Fulfilled (Resolved):** It worked
  - **Rejected:** It did not work
  - **Pending:** Promise has not fulfilled or rejected
  - **Settled:** Promise has fulfilled or rejected
- What will happen when asynchronous task settles
- Promise can only settle once

```js
new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  resolve("hi"); // works
  resolve("bye"); // can't happen a second time
});
```

```js
new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  let value = doSomething():
  if(thingWorked) {
    resolve(value); // Resolved => value gets passed to .then
  } else if (somethingWentWrong) {
    reject(); // Rejected => .catch executed
  }
}).then(function(value) {
  return nextThing(value);
}).catch(rejectFunction);
```

- Resolve leads to the next .then
- Reject leads to the next .catch

### **Command Line cURL**

- cURL is a command line utility that is used to make HTTP requests to a given URL and it outputs the response
  - Allows to see the URL

**[15 Practical Linux cURL Command Examples (cURL Download Examples)](https://www.thegeekstuff.com/2012/04/curl-examples/)**

1. Download a Single File

   - `curl http://www.centos.org`
     - Content of the URL will be displayed in the terminal
   - `curl http://www.centos.org > centos-org.html`
     - Store the output in a file (centos-org.html)

2. Save the cURL Output to a File

   - Save the result of the curl command to a file by using -o/-O options
     - -o (lowercase o) the result will be saved in the filename provided in the command line
     - -O (uppercase O) the filename in the URL will be taken and it will be used as the filename to store the result
   - `curl -o mygettext.html http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html`
     - The page will be saved in the file(mygettext.html)
   - `curl -O http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html`
     - The page will be saved in the file (gettext.html)

3. Fetch Multiple Files at a Time

   - `curl -O http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/index.html -O http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html`
     - `curl -O URL1 -O URL2`
     - Download index.html and gettext.html

4. Follow HTTP Location Headers with -L Option

5. Continue/Resume a Previous Download

   - `curl -C - -O http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html`
     - '-C -' will find from where to start resuming the download
     - 'Ctrl + C' stops the download

6. Limit the Rate of Data Transfer

7. Download a File Only If It Is Modified before/After the Given Time

   - `curl -z 21-Dec-11 http://www.example.com/yy.html`
     - Download if modified later than the given date/time
   - `curl -z -21-Dec-11 http://www.example.com/yy.html`
     - Download if modified befoe the given date/time

8. Pass HTTP Authentication in cURL

9. Download Files from FTP Server

   - `curl -u ftpuser:ftppass -O ftp://ftp_server/public_html/xss.php`
     - Download xss.php from the ftp server
   - `curl -u ftpuser:ftppass -O ftp://ftp_server/public_html/`
     - List all the files and directories under the URL

10. List/Download Using Ranges

    - `curl ftp://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian/pool/main/[a-z]/`
      - List all the packages from a-z ranges

11. Upload Files to FTP Server

    - `curl -u ftpuser:ftppass -T myfile.txt ftp://ftp.testserver.com`
    - `curl -u ftpuser:ftppass -T "{file1,file2}" ftp://ftp.testserver.com`
      - '-T' is used to upload files to the FTP server
      - Upload a file or multiple files to the FTP server

12. More Information using Verbose and Trace Option

13. Get Definition of a Word using DICT Protocol

14. Use Proxy to Download a File

15. Send Mail using SMTP Protocol

### **Character Encoding**

- Character encoding provides a key to unlock the code

### **DNS (Domain Name System)**

- DNS is used to translate human-memorable domain names (example.com) and hostnames into the corresponding IP addresses
- Without DNS, internet will collapse

#### **Record Types**

- `A:` Most common, map a hostnames to IP address (IPv4, 32-bit address)
- `NS:` Name Server that is responsible for a DNS zone
- `MX:` Mail Exchange record specified where email gets sent to
- `CNAME:` Canonical Name, an alias for another hostname
- `AAAA:` Similar to A, but uses IPv6, 128-bit address

#### \*\*Dig - DNS Lookup Utility

- `dig +trace google.com` in the command line
  - Returns four request-response stages
  1. Root Name Servers - (\*.root-servers.net)
     - Name server for the root zone of the DNS of the Internet
     - Answers requests for records in the root zone
     - Answers other requests by returning a list of the authoritative name servers (ANS) for the appropriate TLD
  - First step in resolving human-readable host names into IP addresses that are used in communication between Internet hosts
  2. .com Top Level Domain (TLD) - (\*.gtld-servers.net)
     - TLD names are installed in the root zone of the name sapce
     - TLD for 'www.example.com' is '.com'
  3. google.com Name Servers (NS) - (ns\*.google.com)
     - Server component of the DNS
     - NS record delegates a DNS zone to use the given authoritative name servers
  4. Address Records (A) - (address)
     - IP addresses listed in the address records are servers hosing the domain

### **Express**

- Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications
- Express is one of the most used web frameworks in the Node community
