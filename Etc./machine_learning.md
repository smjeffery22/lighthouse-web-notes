# MACHINE LEARNING (ML)

  - ML is the study of computer algorithms that improve automatically through experience
  - Subset of artificial intelligence (AI)
  - Build a mathematical model based on sample data (i.e. training data)
    - to make predictions/decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so

## MODEL

  - Representation of real world processes
  - 'Classical' models are built manually, through theory and prior experimentation
  - With ML, the model is generated by analyzing sampled & labelled data
