# Library vs. Framework

* The main difference between library and framework:
  * Who is controlling Who?
    * Are you in control of your code (making choices)?
    * Are you following someone else's rules

## Library
* You use library when you need it (i.e. to save time)
  * Ex. Using jQuery in your code when you need it
    * Can be easily changed to something else

## Framework
* Framework calls your code
  * You need to follow the framework's rules
  * Framework tells you where to put your code if you want the framework to work
