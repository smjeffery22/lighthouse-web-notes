# TESTING

## TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (TDD)

  - To work in red-green loop

  - *Step Zero* workflow; taking time to think about what exactly it is that need to be built and how
    1. *Write the smallest possible test case* that matches what we need to program
    2. *Run the test and watch it fail*
        - To write only the code that makes it pass
    3. Write code to *make the test pass*
    4. Run test suite; *repeat stepts 3 and 4 until all tests pass*
    5. Go back and *refactor* the new code while passing the tests

## BEHAVIOUR-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (BDD)

  - Idea built on top of TDD; to *write tests as specifications of system behaviour*
  - Lead to think more clearly and write tests that are easier to understand and maintain
